    <h1>Headers are confusing to me</h1>
    
    <h2> This is h2; up above is h1</h2>
    <p>Apparently, h1 should only be used once, but h2-h6 should be nested under one another in order</p>
    
    <h2>So this is an h2</h2>
    <h3 id="linktest">This is an h3</h3>
    <h4>This is an h4</h4>
    <h5>This is an h5</h5>
    <h6>This is an h6</h6>
    <p>And those are all of them. This right here is a paragraph under the h6 sample. Hm, h6 is super small. That's odd.</p>
    
    <h2>I'm trying to explain the concept to Spawn1, so here's an h2 for him.</h2>
    
    <h3>Spawn1's Unordered List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbeez</li>
        <li>
            Armies
            <ol>
                <li>Now stuff is inside armies</li>
                <li>So I can test out ordered lists</li>
                <li>As well as nesting lists</li>
                <li>Coooool I guess</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A slice of carrots</li>
        <li>One tiny wood</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Trying to do stuffs<br>
    I'm impatient</p>
    <p>This is a test paragraph to ensure I remember what <em>em for emphasis</em> and <strong>strong... for strong</strong> look like on page.</p>
    
    <h2>Where am I learning this?</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.htmldog.com">HTML Dog</a> of course.<br>
    <a href="http://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html-introduction.html">This place</a> seems like a wonderful resource, and super comprehensive as well.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Now I'll test link to another part of this page, where it says "This is an h3."</h3>
    <p><a href="#linktest">Try it out!</a> It should bring you up near the top. It's achieved by adding an id into the h3 opening bracket, like
        &lt;h3 id="linktest"&gt;
        Header Text
        &lt;/h3&gt;,
    then linking to that id using
        &lt;a href="http://www.htmldog.com"&gt;HTML Dog&lt;/a&gt;.

    <h2>Uh-oh, now it's tables</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
            <td>Row 1, cell 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, cell 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
            <td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
            <td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 3, cell 1</td>
            <td>Row 3, cell 2</td>
            <td>Row 3, cell 3</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Forms!</h2>
    <p>Okay. Forms are a big'n. There's a whole lot that goes into this. "input" is the most common function as it defines the type of information gathered by a field. HTML Dog has a reference list of input types <a href="http://htmldog.com/references/html/tags/input/">here</a>.</p>
    
    <input type="text" name="letsbegin"><br>
    <textarea rows="3" cols="20">Anything to tell me?</textarea>
